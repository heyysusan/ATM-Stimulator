# ATM Simulation Program

This project simulates the behavior of an ATM using Python and the Tkinter library. The program allows users to:

- Display their bank account balance
- Deposit money into their account
- Withdraw money from their account
- Exit the ATM

## How to Run the Program

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**:
    - You need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Tkinter**:
    - Tkinter is usually included with Python, but if you don't have it, you can install it using the following command:
      ```bash
      pip install tk
      ```

3. **Download the Script**:
    - Download the `atm_simulation.py` script from this repository.

4. **Run the Script**:
    - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script and run it using:
      ```bash
      python atm_simulation.py
      ```

## Usage

1. **Access ATM**:
    - When you run the script, a window will appear with a button labeled "Access ATM". Click this button to start using the ATM.

2. **PIN Verification**:
    - The program will prompt you to enter a PIN. The default PIN is `1234`. You have three attempts to enter the correct PIN. If the correct PIN is not entered within three attempts, the program will exit.

3. **Main Menu**:
    - After entering the correct PIN, the main menu will be displayed. You will have the following options:
        - `1`: Display Balance
        - `2`: Deposit Money
        - `3`: Withdraw Money
        - `4`: Exit

### Options Detail

- **Display Balance**:
    - Select option `1` to display your current account balance. A message box will show the balance.

- **Deposit Money**:
    - Select option `2` to deposit money into your account. You will be prompted to enter the amount to deposit. If the entered amount is positive, it will be added to your balance, and a confirmation message will be displayed.

- **Withdraw Money**:
    - Select option `3` to withdraw money. A sub-menu will appear with predefined amounts (£10, £20, £50, £100, £200) and an option for "Other Amount".
        - If you choose a predefined amount, the withdrawal will be processed if the amount is a multiple of 10 and does not exceed the current balance.
        - If you choose "Other Amount", you will be prompted to enter a custom amount. The custom amount must be a multiple of 10 and within the available balance to be processed.

- **Exit**:
    - Select option `4` to exit the program. A goodbye message will be displayed, and the program will close.

### Important Notes

- **Initial Balance**:
    - The initial balance is set to £1000.

- **Withdrawal Conditions**:
    - Withdrawals must be in multiples of £10.
    - The withdrawal amount must not exceed the current balance.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
- **Tkinter**: The Tkinter library is used for the graphical interface.

## Troubleshooting

- **Incorrect PIN**:
    - If you enter an incorrect PIN three times, the program will exit. Restart the program to try again.

- **Invalid Amounts**:
    - When depositing or withdrawing, ensure the amounts are valid (positive integers for deposits and multiples of 10 for withdrawals).
